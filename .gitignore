# Ignore files with no extension (keep directories accessible)
# NOTE: removed a previously broad rule that ignored most files ("[^.]*").
# That pattern caused regular source files to be ignored (e.g. Graph/CentroidDecomposition.cpp).
# Keep directory allowance, but do not ignore all non-dot-starting files.
